          Are personal finance and budgeting topics of interest to you? Do you want to discover the many stacks that may be used to develop a full-stack web application? If so, you might be interested in my most recent project!  
     </p>
        <h3 class="blog-text">Goal for my Project</h3>
      <p class="blog-text">
        I made the decision to create a budgeting app during the Dev Academy boot camp utilising as many different stacks as I could, including React, TypeScript, and Redux for the front end and Node.js, Express, Knex, SQLite/Postgres for the database and server side. Additionally, I employed Dokku for deployment and Auth0 for authentication. Furthermore, I discovered how to use Material UI to enhance the app's user experience.
      </p>
      
      <p class="blog-text"> 
        My goal for this project was to apply the skills and knowledge I learned during the boot camp to build a personal finance/budgeting app. I started by writing user stories and creating a wireframe for the layout. However, I quickly realized that I wasn't very good at designing the layout, so I decided to use a wireframe that I found on the internet.
      </p>
      <img class="figure" src="../../Image/Stacks.png" alt="class-output-example">
      <p class="blog-text">
        I started building the app by creating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions and then adding functionality such as creating a budget, adding expenses, and displaying the current balance. I also used nocks and mocks for integration testing to ensure that the app worked correctly. I began to research ways to show the data nicely for the user and came across Material Ui. I quickly fell in love with their designs and started employing their components into my app. I have used their select input, cards, modals, data grid buttons and many more. Learning how to use their functionality through the document was a fun experience!

        Reflecting
      </h3>
      <p class="blog-text">
        Looking back on this project, I realize that there are a few things I would do differently if given the chance. For instance, I would definitely change how I handled the date system, since using the month names as values made it difficult to convert them in the back end. I also noticed some limitations with the Material UI library. While it's very visually appealing and relatively user-friendly, I encountered a bug with the DataGrid component when trying to render it out through testing. Unfortunately, I had to skip testing this component as I couldn't solve the issue. Additionally, the input required function in Material UI didn't behave like the normal HTML behavior, allowing users to submit blank input.      </p>    
      <p class="blog-text">
        However, I'm excited to explore new approaches to styling my future apps. In particular, I'm currently considering using Tailwind, which I believe will offer more flexibility and customization options.      </p>
     
      <p class="blog-text">
        All in all, this project taught me a lot about using different stacks together, writing user stories, and conducting integration testing. It was a great opportunity for me to apply my skills and knowledge to build something that I'm truly interested in.
