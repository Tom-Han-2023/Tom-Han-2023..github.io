        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
      </h3>
       <p class="blog-text">
        <ul class="blog-text">
          <li>
            I learnt that I often think too much about the past or worry about the future rather than thinking about the present moment.                   
            </li>
          <li>
            That I need to learn to take adequate breaks, I have learned that taking breaks is very important to keep myself fresh and efficient.
           </li>
          <li>
            Despite knowing about the growth mindset previously, I realized that I still possess a fixed mindset to a certain degree.
           </li>
        </ul>
        </p> 

      <h3 class="blog-text">
        What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Value helps an individual to determine what is important. Our actions and decisions are guided by our values. Values can motivate learning in specific areas of study and guide their approach to problem-solving.
         </p>
         <p class="blog-text">
          Empathy enables people to comprehend and value various perspectives and can promote collaboration and teamwork in educational and programming environments. 
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Self-awareness is crucial for learning and programming because it enables people to reflect their own thought patterns and recognise their own strengths and weaknesses. As a result, people may be more able to accept difficulties, grow as learners, and enhance their skills over time.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-text">
          What has surprised you the most about core learning?
          </h3> 
        <p class="blog-text"> 
          As mentioned earlier, despite knowing about the growth mindset previously, I realized that I still possess a fixed mindset to a certain degree.  I think this sort of mindset can hinder my ability to learn and create a limit for myself.  This is something I need to work on. 
           </p>
        <h3 class="blog-text">
          What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Understanding the concepts was not really a problem for me but actually applying these concepts in my daily life was the most challenging. Sometimes even though we know that it is important to do something, it can be difficult as it can be outside our comfort zone. Stepping out of this comfort zone was definitely the most challenging aspect of core learning. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-text">
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
         </h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          This is because Devacademy is about teaching how to work in a real life setting. Often companies won't look for the smartest person in the room, but a person who would fit well in the team’s culture and improve it. Having the core skills is vital for a person to be a great programmer. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-text">
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.
         </h3> 
         <p class="blog-text">
          It definitely wasn’t a waste of time. Improving core skills is very important for personal development. It helps to improve collaboration with other people, reflect back on my actions to see if there are any other ways I could improve, develop emotional intelligence and may more. These are all vital to help become a better programmer.
